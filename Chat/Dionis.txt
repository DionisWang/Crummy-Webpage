Dionis: Hello guys!
JAson: date finder is done, we don't really need to check the two numbers, months are enough
Jerry: put your date finder, waiting for name finder and html pages 
Dionis: Namefinder done. Input a string and it returns a list of names from  highest occurence to lowest occurence. Though finding the name is only as good as the dictionaries it has.
Jerry: wat the hek am i supposed to run in namefinder
Jerry: nvm i got it , html pls
Jerry: 1:06AM ITS DONE i guess
